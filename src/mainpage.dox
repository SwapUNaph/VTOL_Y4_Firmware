/**
\mainpage PX4 Autopilot Flight Control Stack and Middleware

This software repository offers a middleware for micro aerial vehicles capable of running efficiently on a 168 MHz Cortex M4F processor and a state of the art flight control stack supporting multicopter and fixed wing aircraft. It can be easily used for experimental air (and ground) vehicles as well, as the application on a spherical blimp shows.
