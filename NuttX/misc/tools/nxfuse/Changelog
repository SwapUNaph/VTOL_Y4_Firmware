1.0 2016-01-07  Ken Pettit <pettitkd@gmail.com>

	* Initial Release
	* Support for SmartFS filesystems on regular files or Linux block
	  files (e.g. /dev/loop0, /dev/sdb, etc.)

1.1 2016-01-08  Ken Pettit <pettitkd@gmail.com>

	* Added support for mounting and creating SmartFS multi-root 
	  directories.  Only a single root directory can be mounted at a
	  time becasue FUSE launches separate clone applications for each
	  Linux mount.
	* Added support for program version reporting.

1.2 2016-01-08  Ken Pettit <pettitkd@gmail.com>

	* Fixed the NXFFS implementation so it works (within the confines of
	  the NXFFS architectural limitations).
	* Updates to the man page and README files to reflect functional
	  NXFFS operation status.
