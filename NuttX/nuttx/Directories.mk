#   descriptor support but is always built because there are other components
#   in the drivers directory that are needed even if file descriptors are not
#   supported.
# CONTEXTDIRS include directories that have special, one-time pre-build
#   requirements.  Normally this includes things like auto-generation of
#   configuration specific files or creation of configurable symbolic links
# USERDIRS - When NuttX is build is a monolithic kernel, this provides the
#   list of directories that must be built
# OTHERDIRS - These are directories that are not built but probably should
#   be cleaned to prevent garbage from collecting in them when changing
#   configurations.
