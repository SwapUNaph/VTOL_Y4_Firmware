/* Common commands
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_INIT
 * DESCRIPTION:   Perform one-time application initialization.
 * ARG:           The boardctl() argument is passed to the
 *                board_app_initialize() implementation without modification.
 *                The argument has no meaning to NuttX; the meaning of the
 *                argument is a contract between the board-specific
 *                initalization logic and the the matching application logic.
 *                The value cold be such things as a mode enumeration value,
 *                a set of DIP switch switch settings, a pointer to
 *                configuration data read from a file or serial FLASH, or
 *                whatever you would like to do with it.  Every
 *                implementation should accept zero/NULL as a default
 *                configuration.
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide board_app_initialize()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_POWEROFF
 * DESCRIPTION:   Power off the board
 * ARG:           Integer value providing power off status information
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_POWEROFF
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_power_off() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_RESET
 * DESCRIPTION:   Reset the board
 * ARG:           Integer value providing power off status information
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_RESET
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_reset() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_UNIQUEID
 * DESCRIPTION:   Return a unique ID associated with the board (such as a
 *                serial number or a MAC address).
 * ARG:           A writable array of size CONFIG_BOARDCTL_UNIQUEID_SIZE in
 *                which to receive the board unique ID.
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_uniqueid() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_APP_SYMTAB
 * DESCRIPTION:   Select the application symbol table.  This symbol table
 *                provides the symbol definitions exported to application
 *                code from application space.
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_symtab_s
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_APP_SYMTAB
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_OS_SYMTAB
 * DESCRIPTION:   Select the OS symbol table.  This symbol table provides
 *                the symbol definitions exported by the OS to kernel
 *                modules.

 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL && CONFIG_BOARDCTL_USBDEVCTRL
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide board_<usbdev>_initialize()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_NX_START
 * DESCRIPTION:   Start the NX servier
 * ARG:           None
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSER
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Base graphics logic provides nx_start()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_TSCTEST_SETUP
 * DESCRIPTION:   Touchscreen controller test configuration
 * ARG:           Touch controller device minor number
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL && CONFIG_BOARDCTL_TSCTEST
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide board_tsc_setup()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_TSCTEST_TEARDOWN

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: boardctl
 *
 * Description:
 *   In a small embedded system, there will typically be a much greater
 *   interaction between application and low-level board features.  The
 *   canonically correct to implement such interactions is by implementing a
 *   character driver and performing the interactions via low level ioctl
 *   calls.  This, however, may not be practical in many cases and will lead
 *   to "correct" but awkward implementations.
 *
 *   boardctl() is non-standard OS interface to alleviate the problem.  It
 *   basically circumvents the normal device driver ioctl interlace and allows
 *   the application to perform direct IOCTL-like calls to the board-specific
 *   logic.  It is especially useful for setting up board operational and
 *   test configurations.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cmd - Identifies the board command to be executed
 *   arg - The argument that accompanies the command.  The nature of the
 *         argument is determined by the specific command.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success zero (OK) is returned; -1 (ERROR) is returned on failure
 *   with the errno variable to to indicate the nature of the failure.
