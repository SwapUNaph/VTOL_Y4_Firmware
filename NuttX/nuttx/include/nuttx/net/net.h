/****************************************************************************
 * Function: psock_accept
 *
 * Description:
 *   The psock_accept function is used with connection-based socket types
 *   (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET and SOCK_RDM). It extracts the first
 *   connection request on the queue of pending connections, creates a new
 *   connected socket with mostly the same properties as 'sockfd', and
 *   allocates a new socket descriptor for the socket, which is returned. The
 *   newly created socket is no longer in the listening state. The original
 *   socket 'sockfd' is unaffected by this call.  Per file descriptor flags
 *   are not inherited across an psock_accept.
 *
 *   The 'sockfd' argument is a socket descriptor that has been created with
 *   socket(), bound to a local address with bind(), and is listening for
 *   connections after a call to listen().
 *
 *   On return, the 'addr' structure is filled in with the address of the
 *   connecting entity. The 'addrlen' argument initially contains the size
 *   of the structure pointed to by 'addr'; on return it will contain the
 *   actual length of the address returned.
 *
 *   If no pending connections are present on the queue, and the socket is
 *   not marked as non-blocking, psock_accept blocks the caller until a
 *   connection is present. If the socket is marked non-blocking and no
 *   pending connections are present on the queue, psock_accept returns
 *   EAGAIN.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock    Reference to the listening socket structure
 *   addr     Receives the address of the connecting client
 *   addrlen  Input: allocated size of 'addr', Return: returned size of 'addr'
 *   newsock  Location to return the accepted socket information.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  Returns 0 (OK) on success.  On failure, it returns -1 (ERROR) with the
 *  errno variable set to indicate the nature of the error.
 *
 * EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
 *   The socket is marked non-blocking and no connections are present to
 *   be accepted.
 * EOPNOTSUPP
 *   The referenced socket is not of type SOCK_STREAM.
 * EINTR
 *   The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught before
 *   a valid connection arrived.
 * ECONNABORTED
 *   A connection has been aborted.
 * EINVAL
 *   Socket is not listening for connections.
 * EMFILE
 *   The per-process limit of open file descriptors has been reached.
 * ENFILE
 *   The system maximum for file descriptors has been reached.
 * EFAULT
 *   The addr parameter is not in a writable part of the user address
 *   space.

 *   Not enough free memory.
 * EPROTO
 *   Protocol error.
 * EPERM

 * Name: psock_connect
 *
 * Description:
 *   connect() connects the socket referred to by the structure 'psock'
 *   to the address specified by 'addr'. The addrlen argument specifies
 *   the size of 'addr'.  The format of the address in 'addr' is
 *   determined by the address space of the socket 'psock'.
 *
 *   If the socket 'psock' is of type SOCK_DGRAM then 'addr' is the address
 *   to which datagrams are sent by default, and the only address from which
 *   datagrams are received. If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or
 *   SOCK_SEQPACKET, this call attempts to make a connection to the socket
 *   that is bound to the address specified by 'addr'.
 *
 *   Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect()

 *   If from is not NULL, and the underlying protocol provides the source
 *   address, this source address is filled in. The argument fromlen
 *   initialized to the size of the buffer associated with from, and modified
 *   on return to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock    A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *   buf      Buffer to receive data
 *   len      Length of buffer
 *   flags    Receive flags
 *   from     Address of source (may be NULL)
 *   fromlen  The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  If no data is
 *   available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown,
 *   recv() will return 0.  Otherwise, on errors, -1 is returned, and errno
 *   is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN
 *     The socket is marked non-blocking and the receive operation would block,
 *     or a receive timeout had been set and the timeout expired before data
 *     was received.
 *   EBADF
 *     The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.
 *   ECONNREFUSED
 *     A remote host refused to allow the network connection (typically because
 *     it is not running the requested service).
 *   EFAULT
 *     The receive buffer pointer(s) point outside the process's address space.
 *   EINTR
 *     The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data were
 *     available.
 *   EINVAL
 *     Invalid argument passed.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     Could not allocate memory.
 *   ENOTCONN
 *     The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol and has
 *     not been connected.

 * Description:

 *   send() is equivalent to write(). Also, send(sockfd,buf,len,flags) is
 *   equivalent to sendto(sockfd,buf,len,flags,NULL,0).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock    An instance of the internal socket structure.
 *   buf      Data to send
 *   len      Length of data to send
 *   flags    Send flags
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  On  error,
 *   -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
 *     The socket is marked non-blocking and the requested operation
 *     would block.
 *   EBADF
 *     An invalid descriptor was specified.
 *   ECONNRESET
 *     Connection reset by peer.
 *   EDESTADDRREQ
 *     The socket is not connection-mode, and no peer address is set.
 *   EFAULT
 *      An invalid user space address was specified for a parameter.
 *   EINTR
 *      A signal occurred before any data was transmitted.
 *   EINVAL
 *      Invalid argument passed.
 *   EISCONN
 *     The connection-mode socket was connected already but a recipient
 *     was specified. (Now either this error is returned, or the recipient
 *     specification is ignored.)
 *   EMSGSIZE
 *     The socket type requires that message be sent atomically, and the
 *     size of the message to be sent made this impossible.
 *   ENOBUFS
 *     The output queue for a network interface was full. This generally
 *     indicates that the interface has stopped sending, but may be
 *     caused by transient congestion.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     No memory available.
 *   ENOTCONN
 *     The socket is not connected, and no target has been given.
 *   ENOTSOCK
 *     The argument s is not a socket.
 *   EOPNOTSUPP
 *     Some bit in the flags argument is inappropriate for the socket
 *     type.
 *   EPIPE
 *     The local end has been shut down on a connection oriented socket.
 *     In this case the process will also receive a SIGPIPE unless
 *     MSG_NOSIGNAL is set.
