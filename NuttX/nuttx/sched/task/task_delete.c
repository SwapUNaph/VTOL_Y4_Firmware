/****************************************************************************
 * Name: task_delete
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function causes a specified task to cease to exist. Its  stack and
 *   TCB will be deallocated.  This function is the companion to task_create().
 *   This is the version of the function exposed to the user; it is simply
 *   a wrapper around the internal, task_terminate function.
 *
 *   The logic in this function only deletes non-running tasks.  If the 'pid'
 *   parameter refers to to the currently runing task, then processing is
 *   redirected to exit().  This can only happen if a task calls task_delete()
 *   in order to delete itself.
 *
 *   In fact, this function (and task_terminate) are the final functions
 *   called all task termination sequences.  task_delete may be called
 *   from:
 *
 *   - task_restart(),
 *   - pthread_cancel(),
 *   - and directly from user code.
 *
 *   Other exit paths (exit(), _eixt(), and pthread_exit()) will go through
 *   task_terminate()
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   pid - The task ID of the task to delete.  A pid of zero
 *         signifies the calling task.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   OK on success; or ERROR on failure
 *
 *   This function can fail if the provided pid does not correspond to a
 *   task (errno is not set)
 *
