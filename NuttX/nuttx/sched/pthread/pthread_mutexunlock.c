 * Name: pthread_mutex_unlock
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_mutex_unlock() function releases the mutex object referenced
 *   by mutex. The manner in which a mutex is released is dependent upon the
 *   mutex's type attribute. If there are threads blocked on the mutex object
 *   referenced by mutex when pthread_mutex_unlock() is called, resulting in
 *   the mutex becoming available, the scheduling policy is used to determine
 *   which thread shall acquire the mutex. (In the case of PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
 *   mutexes, the mutex becomes available when the count reaches zero and the
 *   calling thread no longer has any locks on this mutex).
 *
 *   If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a mutex, upon return from
 *   the signal handler the thread resumes waiting for the mutex as if it was
 *   not interrupted.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
