 * Name: pthread_getspecific
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_getspecific() function returns the value currently
 *   bound to the specified key on behalf of the calling thread.
 *
 *   The effect of calling pthread_getspecific() with with a key value
 *   not obtained from pthread_create() or after a key has been deleted
 *   with pthread_key_delete() is undefined.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   key = The data key to get or set
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   The function pthread_getspecific() returns the thread-specific data
 *   associated with the given key.  If no thread specific data is
 *   associated with the key, then the value NULL is returned.
 *
 *      EINVAL - The key value is invalid.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   - Both calling pthread_setspecific() and pthread_getspecific()
 *     may be called from a thread-specific data destructor
 *     function.
