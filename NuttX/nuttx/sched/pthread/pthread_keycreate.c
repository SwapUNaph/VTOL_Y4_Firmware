 * Name: pthread_key_create
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function creates a thread-specific data key visible to all threads
 *   in the system.  Although the same key value may be used by different
 *   threads, the values bound to the key by pthread_setspecific() are
 *   maintained on a per-thread basis and persist for the life of the calling
 *   thread.
 *
 *   Upon key creation, the value NULL will be associated with the new key
 *   in all active threads.  Upon thread creation, the value NULL will be
 *   associated with all defined keys in the new thread.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   key = A pointer to the key to create.
 *   destructor = An optional destructor() function that may be associated
 *      with each key that is invoked when a thread exits.  However, this
 *      argument is ignored in the current implementation.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   If successful, the pthread_key_create() function will store the newly
 *   created key value at *key and return zero (OK).  Otherwise, an error
 *   number will bereturned to indicate the error:
 *
 *      EAGAIN - The system lacked sufficient resources to create another
 *         thread-specific data key, or the system-imposed limit on the total
 *         number of keys pers process {PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX} has been exceeded
 *      ENONMEM - Insufficient memory exists to create the key.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   - The present implementation ignores the destructor argument.
