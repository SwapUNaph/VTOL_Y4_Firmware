    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.

      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function.
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <b>Other Tricks</b>

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXConfigVariables.html">Configuration Variable Documentation</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

        with console output visible on UART0, and the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>)
        is fully functional with interrupt driven serial console.  An SPI driver is available
        but only partially tested.  Additional features are needed: USB driver, MMC integration,
        to name two (the slot on the board appears to accept on MMC card dimensions; I have only
        SD cards).
        An SPI-based ENC28J60 Ethernet driver for add-on hardware is available and
        but has not been fully verified on the Olimex board (due to issues powering the ENC28J60 add-on board).

      Two boards based on the NXP LPC3131 are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <p>
            First, a port for the NXP <a href="http://ics.nxp.com/products/lpc3000/lpc313x.lpc314x.lpc315x/">LPC3131</a> on the <a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/kits/lpc3131_kit.php">Embedded Artists EA3131</a> development board was first released in NuttX-5.1 (but was not functional until NuttX-5.2).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <b>STATUS:</b>
            The basic EA3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-5.2.
            This basic port includes basic boot-up, serial console, and timer interrupts.
            This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
            David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.
            This port has been verified using the NuttX OS test, USB serial and mass storage tests and includes a working implementation of the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Support for <a href="NuttXDemandPaging.html">on-demand paging</a> has been developed for the EA3131.
            That support would all execute of a program in SPI FLASH by paging code sections out of SPI flash as needed.
            However, as of this writing, I have not had the opportunity to verify this new feature.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <b>STATUS:</b>
            The basic H3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-6.3.
            It is similar to the EA3131 port except:  (1) I have not yet gotten the SDRAM to work, and (2) this board was used to develop and verify the USB 2.0, low-/full-/high-speed EHCI host controller driver.
            NOTE: That driver should work on the EA3131 as well.  However, the EA3131 uses a PCA9532 PWM part to controller the port power so the it would not quite be a simple drop-in.

          Basic support is in place for both the LPC3152 MCU and the EA3152 board.
          Verification of the port was deferred due to tool issues
          However, because of the high degree of compatibility between the LPC313x and LPC315x family, it
          is very likely that the support is in place (or at least very close).
          At this point, verification of the EA3152 port has been overcome by events and
          may never happen.
          However, the port is available for anyone who may want to use it.

        <p>
          <b>STATUS</b>.
          Initial support for the SAMA5D3x-EK was released in NuttX-6.29.
          That initial support was minimal:
          There are simple test configurations that run out of internal SRAM and extended configurations that run out of the on-board NOR FLASH:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A barebones NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that can be used as the basis for further application development.

          <li>
            A full-loaded NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that demonstrates all of the SAMA5D3x features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following support was added in Nuttx 6.30:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DMA support, and
          </li>
          <li>
            PIO interrupts,
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And drivers for
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NuttX-6.30 also introduces full USB support:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With NuttX-6.31, these additional drivers were added:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A 10/100Base-T Ethernet (EMAC) driver,

            A Watchdog Timer (WDT) driver,
          </li>
          <li>
            A Timer/Counter (TC) library with interface that make be used by other drivers that need timer support,
          </li>
          <li>
            An ADC driver that can collect multiple samples using the sequencer, can be trigger by a timer/counter, and supports DMA data transfers,
          </li>
          <li>
            A touchscreen driver based on the special features of the SAMA5D3 ADC peripheral,
            An LCD controller (LCDC) frame buffer driver, and
          </li>
          <li>
            A CAN driver (Testing of the CAN has been delayed because of cabling issues).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additional board configurations were added to test and demonstrate these new drivers including new graphics and NxWM configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These drivers were added in NuttX-6.32:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A PWM driver with DMA support
          </li>
          <li>
            An SSC-based I2S driver
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for Programmable clock outputs
          </li>
          <li>
            NAND support including support for the PMECC hardware ECC and for DMA transfers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DBGU support was added in NuttX-7.2 (primarily for the SAMA5D3 Xplained board).
        </p>
        <p>
          NuttX-7.4 added support for the on-board WM8904 CODEC chip and for <i>Tickless</i> operation.

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STATUS</b>.
          This port is complete as of this writing and ready for general use.
          The basic port is expected to be simple because of the similarity to the SAMAD3<i>x</i>-EK boards and is available in the NuttX 7.2 release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the drivers and capabilities of the SAMA5D3x-EK boards can be used with the SAMA5D3 Xplained board.
          The primary difference between the ports is that the SAMA5D3x-EK supports NOR FLASH and NuttX can be configured to boot directly from NOR FLASH.
          The SAMA5D3 Xplained board does not have NOR FLASH and, as a consequence NuttX must boot into SDRAM with the help of U-Boot.

        In NuttX-7.4 support was added for the L2 cache, many security features, XDMAC, HSMCI and Ethernet integrated with XDMAC, the LCDC, TWI, SSC, and most of the existing SAMA5 drivers.
        Timers were added to support <i>Tickless</i> operation.
        The TM7000 LCDC with the maXTouch multi-touch controller are also fully support in a special NxWM configuration for that larger display.
        Support for a graphics media player is included (although there were issues with the WM8904 audio CODEC on my board).

      A port is underway for the Texas Instruments Hercules TMS570LS04x/03x LaunchPad Evaluation Kit (<i>LAUNCHXL-TMS57004</i>) featuring the Hercules TMS570LS0432PZ chip.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS</b>.
        This is currently in progress but the effort is stalled due to tool-related issues.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/configs/launchxl-tms57004/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Toolchain:</b>
        The TMS570 is a big-endian ARM platform and requires a big-endian ARM toolchain.
        All testing has been performed using a big-endian NuttX buildroot toolchain.
        Instructions for building this toolchain are included in the board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/configs/launchxl-tms57004/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file.

      This is a port of NuttX to the nuvoTon NuTiny-SDK-NUC120 that features the NUC120LE3AN MCU.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
        This initial support is very minimal:
        There is a NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that might be the basis for an application development.
        As of this writing, more device drivers are needed to make this a more complete port.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/configs/nutiny-nuc120/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The NUC120LE2AN comes in a 48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
        When running the NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application development).
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  35037     106    1092   36235    8d8b nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.26
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         14160       3944      10216       10216
nsh>
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 10.0KB (62%) is available for further application development.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Development Environments:</b>
      1) Linux with native Linux GNU toolchain, 2) Cygwin/MSYS with Cygwin GNU toolchain, 3) Cygwin/MSYS
      with Windows native toolchain, or 4) Native Windows.
      A DIY toolchain for Linux or Cygwin is provided by the NuttX

      This is a port of NuttX to the STMicro STM32L-Discovery development board.
      The STM32L-Discovery board is based on the STM32L152RBT6 MCU (128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        The STM32L-Discovery and 32L152CDISCOVERY kits are functionally equivalent.
        The difference is the internal Flash memory size (STM32L152RBT6 with 128 Kbytes or STM32L152RCT6 with 256 Kbytes).
        Both boards feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface,</li>
        <li>LCD (24 segments, 4 commons),</li>
        <li>LEDs,</li>
        <li>Pushbuttons,</li>
        <li>A linear touch sensor, and</li>
        <li>Four touchkeys.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the STM32L-Discovery was released in NuttX-6.28.
        This initial support includes a configuration using the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) that might be the basis for an application development.
        A driver for the on-board segment LCD is included as well as an option to drive the segment LCD from an NSH &quot;built-in&quot; command.
        As of this writing, a few more things are needed to make this a more complete port:  1) Verfication of more device drivers (timers, quadrature encoders, PWM, etc.), and 2) logic that actually uses the low-power consumption modes of the EnergyLite part.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/configs/stm32ldiscovery/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the STM32L152RBT6 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The STM32L152RBT6 comes in a 64-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  39664     132    1124   40920    9fd8 nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 38.7KB of FLASH leaving 89.3B of FLASH (70%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.27
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         14096       3928      10168      10168
nsh>
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 9.9KB (62%) of SRAM heap is staill available for further application development while NSH is running.

      <b>Driver Status</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.20</b>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
            The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
            It should be possible to complete porting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.21</b>
        Added support for a SPIFI block driver and for RS-485 option to the serial driver.
      </li>

        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has 256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM.
        Below is the current memory usage for the NSH configuration (June 9, 2013).
        This is <i>not</i> a minimal implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  43572     122    2380   46074    b3fa nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB (92.7%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command.
        This runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <i>plus</i> all dynamic memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.28
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         29232       5920      23312      23312
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is staill available for further application development while NSH is running.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid.
      The biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for <code>printf()</code> and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

        This port uses the &quot;Advanced USB Storage Demo Board,&quot; Model DB-DP11215, from <a href="http://www.sureelectronics.net">Sure Electronics</a>.
        This board features the MicroChip PIC32MX440F512H.

        (I believe that that the DB-DP11215 may be obsoleted now but replaced with the very similar, DB-DP11212.
        The DB-DP11212 board differs, I believe, only in its serial port configuration.)

       <b>STATUS:</b>
       This NuttX port is code complete and has considerable test testing.
       The port for this board was completed in NuttX 6.11, but still required a few bug fixes before it will be ready for prime time.
       The fully verified port first appeared in NuttX 6.13.
       Available configurations include the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
       An untested USB device-side driver is available in the source tree.
       A more complete port would include support of the USB OTG port and of the LCD display on this board.
       Those drivers are not yet available as of this writing.
       Refer to the NuttX board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/configs/sure-pic32mx/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.

      This port is for the PIC32MX board from PCB Logic Design Co. and used the PIC32MX460F512L.
      The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the PIC32 MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG connector.
    </li>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      The basic port is code complete and fully verified in NuttX 6.13.

      </li>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         This port was started and then shelved for some time until I received the Expansion I/O board.
         The basic Starter Kit (even with the Multimedia Expansion Board, MEB, DM320005)) has no serial port and most NuttX test configurations depend heavily on console output.
      </p>
      <p>
         A verified configuration is available for the NuttShel (NSH) appeared in NuttX-6.16.
         Board support includes a verified USB (device-side) driver.

     <li><b>Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Mulitmedia Board (MMB)</b>.
        A port has been completed for the  Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Multimedia Board (MMB).
        See http://www.mikroe.com/ for further information about this board.

      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         A verified configuration is available for an extensive <a href="NuttShell.html">NuttShell (NSH)</a> configuration.
         The NSH configuration includes:
         (1) Full network support,
         (2) Verified SPI driver,
         (3) SPI-based SD Card support,
         (4) USB device support (including configuration options for the USB mass storage device and the CDC/ACM serial class), and
         (5) Support for the MIO283QT2 LCD on the PIC32MX7 MMB.
         (6) Support for the MIO283QT9A LCD used on later boards (NuttX 7.1).
       </p>
       </p>
         The PIC32MX7 MMB's touchscreen is connected directly to the MCU via ADC pins.
         A touchscreen driver has been developed using the PIC32's ADC capabilities and can be enabled in the NSH configuration.
         However, additional verification and tuning of this driver is required.
         Further display/touchscreen verification would require C++ support (for NxWidgets and NxWM).
         Since I there is no PIC32 C++ is the free version of the MPLAB C32 toolchain, further graphics development is stalled.

       <b>STATUS:</b>
        This port is available as of release 0.3.18 of NuttX.  The port is basically complete
        and many examples run correctly.  However, there are remaining instabilities that
        make the port un-usable.  The nature of these is not understood; the behavior is
        that certain SH-1 instructions stop working as advertised.  This could be a silicon
        problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain
        (which has very limit SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.
        At any rate, I have exhausted all of the energy that I am willing to put into this cool
        old processor for the time being.

      This download may be used to build a NuttX-compatible ELF toolchain under Linux or Cygwin.
      That toolchain will support ARM, m68k, m68hc11, m68hc12, and SuperH ports.

      Also very usable is the Linux environment using the
      <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">SDCC</a> compiler.
      The SDCC compiler provides support for the 8051/2, z80, hc08, and other microcontrollers.
      The SDCC-based logic is less well exercised and you will likely find some compilation
      issues if you use parts of NuttX with SDCC that have not been well-tested.

  </td>

      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies may be suppressed by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, the following Windows native toolchains are in use:
      <ol>
        <li>GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM, etc.),</li>
        <li>SDCC built for Windows,</li>
        <li> the ZiLOG XDS-II toolchain for Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim parts.</li>
      </ol>

      Build support has been added to support building natively in a Windows console rather than in a POSIX-like environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This build:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Uses all Windows style paths</li>
      <li>Uses primarily Windows batch commands from cmd.exe, with</li>
      <li>A few extensions from GNUWin32</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This capability first appeared in NuttX-6.24 and should still be considered a work in progress because: (1) it has not been verfied on all targets and tools, and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more mature environments.
      The windows native build logic initiated if <code>CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y</code> is defined in the NuttX configuration file:
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, this build environment also requires:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Windows Console</b>.
        The build must be performed in a Windows console window.
        This may be using the standard <code>CMD.exe</code> terminal that comes with Windows.
        I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
        http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.
        The build still relies on some Unix-like commands.
        I usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
        See the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for some download, build, and installation notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MinGW-GCC</b>.
        MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the <code>nuttx/tools</code> directory that are neede by the build.
        MinGW-GCC can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
        If you are using GNUWin32, then it is recommended that you not install the optional MSYS components as there may be conflicts.

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make GIT snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>
# diff -u `which winepath` `which cygpath`

</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.
