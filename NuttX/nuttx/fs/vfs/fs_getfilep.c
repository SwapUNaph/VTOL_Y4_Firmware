 * Name: fs_getfilep
 *
 * Description:
 *   Given a file descriptor, return the corresponding instance of struct
 *   file.  NOTE that this function will currently fail if it is provided
 *   with a socket descriptor.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   fd - The file descriptor
 *
 * Return:
 *   A point to the corresponding struct file instance is returned on
 *   success.  On failure,  NULL is returned and the errno value is
 *   set appropriately (EBADF).
