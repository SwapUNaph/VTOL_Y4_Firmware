 * Name: close
 *
 * Description:
 *   close() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any
 *   file and may be reused. Any record locks (see fcntl(2)) held on the file
 *   it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed (regardless
 *   of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).
 *
 *   If fd is the last copy of a particular file descriptor the resources
 *   associated with it are freed; if the descriptor was the last reference
 *   to a file which has been removed using unlink(2) the file is deleted.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   fd   file descriptor to close
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 on success; -1 on error with errno set appropriately.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
