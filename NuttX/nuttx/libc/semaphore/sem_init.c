 * Function: sem_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function initializes the UNAMED semaphore sem. Following a
 *   successful call to sem_init(), the semaophore may be used in subsequent
 *   calls to sem_wait(), sem_post(), and sem_trywait().  The semaphore
 *   remains usable until it is destroyed.
 *
 *   Only sem itself may be used for performing synchronization. The result
 *   of referring to copies of sem in calls to sem_wait(), sem_trywait(),
 *   sem_post(), and sem_destroy() is undefined.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore to be initialized
 *   pshared - Process sharing (not used)
 *   value - Semaphore initialization value
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   0 (OK), or -1 (ERROR) if unsuccessful.
 *
 * Assumptions:
