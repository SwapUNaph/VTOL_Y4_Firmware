README
======

This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
MikroElektronika Mikromedia for STM32F4 development board.  This is
another board support by NuttX that uses the same STM32F407VGT6 MCU
as does the STM32F4-Discovery board. This board, however, has very
different on-board peripherals than does the STM32F4-Discovery:

  - TFT display with touch panel,
  - VS1053 stereo audio codec with headphone jack,
  - SD card slot,
  - Serial FLASH memory,
  - USB OTG FS with micro-AB connector, and
  - Battery connect and batter charger circuit.

See the http://www.mikroe.com/mikromedia/stm32-m4/ for more information
about this board.

Development Environment
=======================

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems.

GNU Toolchain Options
=====================

  Toolchain Configurations
  ------------------------
  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The CodeSourcery GNU toolchain,
  2. The Atollic Toolchain,
  3. The devkitARM GNU toolchain,
  4. Raisonance GNU toolchain, or
  5. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below).

  All testing has been conducted using the CodeSourcery toolchain for Linux.  To use
  the Atollic, devkitARM, Raisonance GNU, or NuttX buildroot toolchain, you simply need to
  add one of the following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig)
  file:

    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y  : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYL=y  : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=y        : The Atollic toolchain under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y      : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_RAISONANCE=y     : Raisonance RIDE7 under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y      : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)

  If you change the default toolchain, then you may also have to modify the PATH in
  the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery (for Windows), Atollic, devkitARM, and Raisonance toolchains are
  Windows native toolchains.  The CodeSourcey (for Linux) and NuttX buildroot
  toolchains are Cygwin and/or Linux native toolchains. There are several limitations
  to using a Windows based toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  The CodeSourcery Toolchain (2009q1)
  -----------------------------------
  The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) does not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  The Atollic "Pro" and "Lite" Toolchain
  --------------------------------------
  One problem that I had with the Atollic toolchains is that the provide a gcc.exe
  and g++.exe in the same bin/ file as their ARM binaries.  If the Atollic bin/ path
  appears in your PATH variable before /usr/bin, then you will get the wrong gcc
  when you try to build host executables.  This will cause to strange, uninterpretable
  errors build some host binaries in tools/ when you first make.

  Also, the Atollic toolchains are the only toolchains that have built-in support for
  the FPU in these configurations.  If you plan to use the Cortex-M4 FPU, you will
  need to use the Atollic toolchain for now.  See the FPU section below for more
  information.

  The Atollic "Lite" Toolchain
  ----------------------------
  The free, "Lite" version of the Atollic toolchain does not support C++ nor
  does it support ar, nm, objdump, or objdcopy. If you use the Atollic "Lite"
  toolchain, you will have to set:

    CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=n

  In order to compile successfully.  Otherwise, you will get errors like:

    "C++ Compiler only available in TrueSTUDIO Professional"

  The make may then fail in some of the post link processing because of some of
  the other missing tools.  The Make.defs file replaces the ar and nm with
  the default system x86 tool versions and these seem to work okay.  Disable all
  of the following to avoid using objcopy:

    CONFIG_RRLOAD_BINARY=n
    CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=n
    CONFIG_MOTOROLA_SREC=n
    CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=n

  devkitARM
  ---------
  The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that the
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
====

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project.

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/stm32,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_vectors.S.  With RIDE, I have to build NuttX
  one time from the Cygwin command line in order to obtain the pre-built
  startup object needed by RIDE.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh mikroe-stm32f4/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you are
  building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE:  Unfortunately, the 4.6.3 EABI toolchain is not compatible with the
  the NXFLAT tools.  See the top-level TODO file (under "Binary loaders") for
  more information about this problem. If you plan to use NXFLAT, please do not
  use the GCC 4.6.3 EABI toochain; instead use the GCC 4.3.3 OABI toolchain.
  See instructions below.

NuttX OABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  The older, OABI buildroot toolchain is also available.  To use the OABI
  toolchain:

  1. When building the buildroot toolchain, either (1) modify the cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3
     configuration to use EABI (using 'make menuconfig'), or (2) use an exising OABI
     configuration such as cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3

  2. Modify the Make.defs file to use the OABI conventions:

    +CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-elf-
    +ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mtune=cortex-m3 -march=armv7-m -mfloat-abi=soft
    +NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-gotoff.ld -no-check-sections
    -CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-eabi-
    -ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=soft
    -NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-pcrel.ld -no-check-sections

NXFLAT Toolchain
================

  If you are *not* using the NuttX buildroot toolchain and you want to use
  the NXFLAT tools, then you will still have to build a portion of the buildroot
  tools -- just the NXFLAT tools.  The buildroot with the NXFLAT tools can
  be downloaded from the NuttX Bitbucket download site
  (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/downloads/).

  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh mikroe-stm32f4/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-nxflat .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly builtNXFLAT binaries.

LEDs
====

The Mikroe-STM32F4 board has no user accessible LEDs onboard, only a power
and "charging" LED.  All visual user output must be performed through the TFT
display.

External LEDs could be added via the expansion headers on the side of the
board, but as this would be a custom configuration, LEDs are not supported
in this port.

PWM
===

The Mikroe-STM32F4 has no real on-board PWM devices, but it does have PWM
pins routed to the expansion I/O headers on the side of the board.

UARTs
=====

The Mikroe-STM32F4 board has no onboard RS-232 line driver, however the
expansion I/O header provides access to USART2 on pins PD5/PD6.  The port
includes support for USART2 configured as /dev/ttyS0.

UART/USART PINS
---------------

USART2
  RX      PD6
  TX      PD5

Default USART/UART Configuration
--------------------------------

USART2 is enabled in all configurations (see */defconfig).  RX and TX are
configured on pins PD6 and PD5, respectively (see include/board.h).

 * Indicates pins that have other on-board functions and should be used only
   with care (See table 5 in the Mikroe-STM32F4 User Guide).  The rest are
   free I/O pins.
** Port H pins are not supported by the MCU

FPU
===

FPU Configuration Options
-------------------------

There are two version of the FPU support built into the STM32 port.

1. Lazy Floating Point Register Save.

   This is an untested implementation that saves and restores FPU registers
   only on context switches.  This means: (1) floating point registers are
   not stored on each context switch and, hence, possibly better interrupt
   performance.  But, (2) since floating point registers are not saved,
   you cannot use floating point operations within interrupt handlers.

   This logic can be enabled by simply adding the following to your .config
   file:

   CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

2. Non-Lazy Floating Point Register Save

   Mike Smith has contributed an extensive re-write of the ARMv7-M exception
   handling logic. This includes verified support for the FPU.  These changes
   have not yet been incorporated into the mainline and are still considered
   experimental.  These FPU logic can be enabled with:

   CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y
   CONFIG_ARMV7M_CMNVECTOR=y

   You will probably also changes to the ld.script in if this option is selected.
   This should work:

   -ENTRY(_stext)
   +ENTRY(__start)         /* Treat __start as the anchor for dead code stripping */
   +EXTERN(_vectors)       /* Force the vectors to be included in the output */

MIO283QT-2/MIO283QT-9A
======================

The original Mikroe-SMT32F4 board as an on-board MIO283QT-2 TFT LCD that can
be configured and used.  This is a 320x240 resolution display with color
capability to 262K colors, though the mio283qt-2 driver in NuttX only
supports 16-bit color depth, or 65K colors.  Changes to both the
mio283qt-2 driver and the driver interface layer would need to be made
to support 24 BPP mode.

UPDATE:  New boards now support a MIO283QT-9A TFT LCD that is not compatible
with the MIO283QT-2.  It uses a different LCD controller.  The default in
all of these configurations is the MIO283QT-2.  But MIO283QT-9A is also
supported and you can switch from the MIO283QT-2 to the MIO283QT-9A by simply
modifying the NuttX configuration

CFLAGS
------

Only recent GCC toolchains have built-in support for the Cortex-M4 FPU.  You will see
the following lines in each Make.defs file:

  ifeq ($(CONFIG_ARCH_FPU),y)
    ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -march=armv7e-m -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 -mfloat-abi=hard
  else
    ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=soft
  endif

Configuration Changes
---------------------

Below are all of the configuration changes that I had to make to configs/stm3240g-eval/nsh2
in order to successfully build NuttX using the Atollic toolchain WITH FPU support:

  -CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=n                       : Enable FPU support
  +CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

  -CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : Disable the CodeSourcery toolchain
  +CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=n

  -CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=n       : Enable the Atollic toolchain
  +CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=y       :

  -CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=y                : Suppress generation FLASH download formats
  +CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=n                : (Only necessary with the "Lite" version)

  -CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=y                       : Suppress generation of C++ code
  +CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=n                       : (Only necessary with the "Lite" version)

See the section above on Toolchains, NOTE 2, for explanations for some of
the configuration settings.  Some of the usual settings are just not supported
by the "Lite" version of the Atollic toolchain.

Mikroe-STM32F4-specific Configuration Options
===============================================

    CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.  This should
       be set to:

       CONFIG_ARCH=arm

    CONFIG_ARCH_family - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_ARM=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM4=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP=stm32

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code to identify the exact
       chip:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_STM32F407VG=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG - Enables special STM32 clock
       configuration features.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG=n

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the configs subdirectory and
       hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=Mikroe-STM32F4 (for the Mikroe-STM32F4 development board)

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32F4_DISCOVERY=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation
       of delay loops

    CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little
       endian)

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (SRAM in this case):

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x00010000 (64Kb)

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20000000

    CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE - Exclude CCM SRAM from the HEAP

    In addition to internal SRAM, SRAM may also be available through the FSMC.
    In order to use FSMC SRAM, the following additional things need to be
    present in the NuttX configuration file:

    CONFIG_HEAP2_BASE - The base address of the SRAM in the FSMC address space (hex)

    CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE - The size of the SRAM in the FSMC address space (decimal)

    CONFIG_ARCH_FPU - The Mikroe-STM32F4 supports a floating point unit (FPU)

       CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
        stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
      used during interrupt handling.

    CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

    CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION - Enables some build in instrumentation that
       cause a 100 second delay during boot-up.  This 100 second delay
       serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibratre
       CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
       the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC until
       the delay actually is 100 seconds.

  Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
  to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32_TIMn
  is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
  the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
  or DAC conversion. Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
  to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
  configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADCm  Reserve timer n to trigger ADCm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,3
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DAC   Reserve timer n for use by DAC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DACm  Reserve timer n to trigger DACm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,2

  For each timer that is enabled for PWM usage, we need the following additional
  configuration settings:

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMx_CHANNEL - Specifies the timer output channel {1,..,4}

  NOTE: The STM32 timers are each capable of generating different signals on
  each of the four channels with different duty cycles.  That capability is
  not supported by this driver:  Only one output channel per timer.

  JTAG Enable settings (by default only SW-DP is enabled):

    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_FULL_ENABLE - Enables full SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP)
    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_NOJNTRST_ENABLE - Enables full SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP)
      but without JNTRST.
    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_SW_ENABLE - Set JTAG-DP disabled and SW-DP enabled

  Mikroe-STM32F4 specific device driver settings

    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_SERIAL_CONSOLE - selects the USARTn (n=1,2,3) or UART
           m (m=4,5) for the console and ttys0 (default is the USART1).
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_RXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered as received.
       This specific the size of the receive buffer
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_TXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered before
       being sent.  This specific the size of the transmit buffer
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_BAUD - The configure BAUD of the UART.  Must be
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_BITS - The number of bits.  Must be either 7 or 8.
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_PARTIY - 0=no parity, 1=odd parity, 2=even parity
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_2STOP - Two stop bits

  Mikroe-STM32F4 CAN Configuration

    CONFIG_CAN - Enables CAN support (one or both of CONFIG_STM32_CAN1 or
      CONFIG_STM32_CAN2 must also be defined)

Configurations
==============

Each Mikroe-STM32F4 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh mikroe-stm32f4/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

If this is a Windows native build, then configure.bat should be used
instead of configure.sh:

    configure.bat Mikroe-STM32F4\<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  fulldemo
  --------
  This is an example that includes an NSH shell over USB that also
  enables all features of the Mikroe-STM32F4 board including the LCD,
  on-board 1M Flash with SMART filesystem, Aux RS-232 serial port on the
  expansion header, etc.  A couple of the NX graphics commands are made
  available via the NSH prompt for performing LCD demonstrations, and the
  nximage example is used as a splash-screen at startup.

  kostest:
  -------
    NOTE: This configuration compiles, but has not been fully tested
          on the hardware yet.

    This configuration directory, performs a simple OS test using
    apps/examples/ostest with NuttX build as a kernel-mode monolithic
    module and the user applications are built separately.  Is
    is recommened to use a special make command; not just 'make' but
    make with the following two arguments:

        make pass1 pass2

    In the normal case (just 'make'), make will attempt to build both user-
    and kernel-mode blobs more or less interleaved.  This actual works!
    However, for me it is very confusing so I prefer the above make command:
    Make the user-space binaries first (pass1), then make the kernel-space
    binaries (pass2)

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. This is the default platform/toolchain in the configuration:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : Cygwin environment on Windows
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : CodeSourcery under Windows

       This is easily changed by modifying the configuration.

    3. At the end of the build, there will be several files in the top-level
       NuttX build directory:

       PASS1:
         nuttx_user.elf    - The pass1 user-space ELF file
         nuttx_user.hex    - The pass1 Intel HEX format file (selected in defconfig)
         User.map          - Symbols in the user-space ELF file

       PASS2:
         nuttx             - The pass2 kernel-space ELF file
         nuttx.hex         - The pass2 Intel HEX file (selected in defconfig)
         System.map        - Symbols in the kernel-space ELF file

    4. Combining .hex files.  If you plan to use the STM32 ST-Link Utility to
       load the .hex files into FLASH, then you need to combine the two hex
       files into a single .hex file.  Here is how you can do that.

       a. The 'tail' of the nuttx.hex file should look something like this
          (with my comments added):

            $ tail nuttx.hex
            # 00, data records
            ...
            :10 9DC0 00 01000000000800006400020100001F0004
            :10 9DD0 00 3B005A0078009700B500D400F300110151
            :08 9DE0 00 30014E016D0100008D
            # 05, Start Linear Address Record
            :04 0000 05 0800 0419 D2
            # 01, End Of File record
            :00 0000 01 FF

          Use an editor such as vi to remove the 05 and 01 records.

       b. The 'head' of the nuttx_user.hex file should look something like
          this (again with my comments added):

            $ head nuttx_user.hex
            # 04, Extended Linear Address Record
            :02 0000 04 0801 F1
            # 00, data records
            :10 8000 00 BD89 01084C800108C8110208D01102087E
            :10 8010 00 0010 00201C1000201C1000203C16002026
            :10 8020 00 4D80 01085D80010869800108ED83010829
            ...

          Nothing needs to be done here.  The nuttx_user.hex file should
          be fine.

       c. Combine the edited nuttx.hex and un-edited nuttx_user.hex
          file to produce a single combined hex file:

          $ cat nuttx.hex nuttx_user.hex >combined.hex

       Then use the combined.hex file with the STM32 ST-Link tool.  If
       you do this a lot, you will probably want to invest a little time
       to develop a tool to automate these steps.


  nsh
  ---
  This is an NSH example that uses USART2 as the console.  Note that
  the Mikroe-STM32F4 board doesn't actually have onboard line drivers
  or a connector for USART2, but it does route the USART2 signals to
  the expansion header.  To use this demo, you would need to connect
  an external 3.3V RS-232 line driver to the USART's I/O lines on the
  expansion header.

  NOTE:  This demo doesn't quite work yet.  I can get output to the
         USART, but so far, I have not gotten nsh to actually come up.


  nx
  --
    An example using the NuttX graphics system (NX).  This example
    focuses on general window controls, movement, mouse and keyboard
    input.

      CONFIG_LCD_LANDSCAPE=y        : 320x240 landscape orientation
      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT2=y        : MIO283QT-2 is the default

    You can the newer  MIO283QT-9A by enabling it in the configuration.

      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT2=n         : Disable the MIO283QT-2
      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT9A=y        : Enable the MIO283QT-9A

  nxlines:
  ------
    An example using the NuttX graphics system (NX).   This example focuses on
    placing lines on the background in various orientations using the
    on-board TFT LCD.

      CONFIG_LCD_LANDSCAPE=y        : 320x240 landscape orientation
      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT2=y        : MIO283QT-2 is the default

    You can the newer  MIO283QT-9A by enabling it in the configuration.

      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT2=n         : Disable the MIO283QT-2
      CONFIG_LCD_MIO283QT9A=y        : Enable the MIO283QT-9A

  nxtext:
  ------
    Another example using the NuttX graphics system (NX).   This
    example focuses on placing text on the background while pop-up
    windows occur.  Text should continue to update normally with
    or without the popup windows present.

  usbnsh:
  -------

    This is another NSH example.  If differs from other 'nsh' configurations
    in that this configurations uses a USB serial device for console I/O.
    Such a configuration is useful on the stm32f4discovery which has no
    builtin RS-232 drivers.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the CodeSourcery toolchain
       for Windows and builds under Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That
       can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Builds under Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : Using Cygwin
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y : CodeSourcery for Windows

    3. This configuration does have UART2 output enabled and set up as
       the system logging device:

       CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR=y               : Use a character device for system logging
       CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH="/dev/ttyS0" : UART2 will be /dev/ttyS0

       However, there is nothing to generate SYLOG output in the default
       configuration so nothing should appear on UART2 unless you enable
       some debug output or enable the USB monitor.

    4. Enabling USB monitor SYSLOG output.  If tracing is enabled, the USB
       device will save encoded trace output in in-memory buffer; if the
       USB monitor is enabled, that trace buffer will be periodically
       emptied and dumped to the system loggin device (UART2 in this
       configuraion):

       CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE=y                   : Enable USB trace feature
       CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE_NRECORDS=128        : Buffer 128 records in memory
       CONFIG_NSH_USBDEV_TRACE=n               : No builtin tracing from NSH
       CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                   : Automatically start the USB monitor
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR=y              : Enable the USB monitor daemon
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_STACKSIZE=2048 : USB monitor daemon stack size
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_PRIORITY=50    : USB monitor daemon priority
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_INTERVAL=2     : Dump trace data every 2 seconds

       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINIT=y    : Enable TRACE output
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECLASS=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACETRANSFERS=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECONTROLLER=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINTERRUPTS=y

    5. By default, this project assumes that you are *NOT* using the DFU
       bootloader.

    Using the Prolifics PL2303 Emulation
    ------------------------------------
    You could also use the non-standard PL2303 serial device instead of
    the standard CDC/ACM serial device by changing:

      CONFIG_CDCACM=y               : Disable the CDC/ACM serial device class
      CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=y       : The CDC/ACM serial device is NOT the console
      CONFIG_PL2303=y               : The Prolifics PL2303 emulation is enabled
      CONFIG_PL2303_CONSOLE=y       : The PL2303 serial device is the console
