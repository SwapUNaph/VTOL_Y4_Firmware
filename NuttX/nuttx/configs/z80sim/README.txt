z80sim README
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This port uses a primitive, emulated Z80 and the SDCC toolchain.
This port uses an instruction set simulator called z80sim.

The SDCC toolchain is available from http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/.  All
testing has been performed using version 2.6.0 of the SDCC toolchain.

Configuring NuttX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  ostest

    This configuration performs a simple, minimal OS test using
    examples/ostest.  This can be configurated as follows:

    1) From a POSIX window:
       cd tools
       ./configure.sh z80sim/ostest
    2) From a CMD.exe window
       setenv.bat

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  See the
       "Reconfiguring" section below for information about changing this
       configuration.

    2. The default setup for this configuration uses a windows native build.
       See the section entitled "Reconfiguring for Linux, OSX, or Cygwin"
       which will give you the steps you would need to do to convert this
       configuration to build in other, Unix-like environments.

    3. This configuration was last verified sucessfully prior to the
       the configure to Kconfig/mconf tool using SDCC 2.6.0 built to run
       natively under Cygwin.  The current build requires ca. 3.2.1 SDCC.

  nsh

    This configuration file builds NSH (examples/nsh).  This
    configuration is not functional due to issues with use of the
    simulated serial driver (see the TODO list).

    This configuration can be selected by:

    1) From a POSIX window:
       cd tools
       ./configure.sh z80sim/nsh
    2) From a CMD.exe window
       setenv.bat

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  See the
       "Reconfiguring" section below for information about changing this
       configuration.

    2. The default setup for this configuration uses a windows native build.
       See the section entitled "Reconfiguring for Linux, OSX, or Cygwin"
       which will give you the steps you would need to do to convert this
       configuration to build in other, Unix-like environments.

    3. This configuration was last verified sucessfully prior to the
       the configure to Kconfig/mconf tool using SDCC 2.6.0 built to run
       natively under Cygwin.nsh/defconfig:CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC

  pashello

    Configures to use examples/pashello for execution from FLASH
    See examples/README.txt for information about pashello.

    This configuration is not usable because the resulting binary
    is too large for the z80 address space.

    This configuration can be selected by:

    1) From a POSIX window:
       cd tools
       ./configure.sh z80sim/pashello
    2) From a CMD.exe window
       setenv.bat

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  See the
       "Reconfiguring" section below for information about changing this
       configuration.

       natively under Cygwin.nsh/defconfig:CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC

Reconfiguring NuttX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These configurations all use the kconfig-frontends, mconf-based configuration
tool.  To change this configuration using that tool, you should:

  a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt and
     additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

  b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the reconfiguration
     process.

Reconfiguring for Linux, OSX, or Cygwin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the z80 configurations in this this directory are set up to build in a
Windows CMD.exe shell.  This configuration requires the MinGW host compiler
and severl GNUWin32 tools (see discussion in the top-level NuttX/README.txt
file).

These configurations can be converted to run under Linux (or Cygwin or OSX),
by modifying the configuration file as follows:

  -CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y
  -CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y
  +CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y

  -CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCW=y
  +CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCL=y

You may need to first manually change the CONFIG_APPS_DIR="..\apps" definition
in the .config file because the backslash may upset some Unix-based tools.

This configuration will require a recent version of SDCC (ca. 3.2.1) for Linux
or custom built for Cygwin (see below).

You cannot use the default setenv.bat in these Unix-like enviroments because
that is a Windows batch file.  Use configs/z80sim/script/setenv.sh instead.
setenv.sh must include the path to the installation location of SDCC (probably
/usr/local/bin).

SDCC
^^^^

These z80 configurations all use the SDCC toolchain (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).
Source and pre-built SDCC binaries can be downloaded from the SDCC SourceForge
site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc/files/ .  Pre-built binaries are
available for Linux, MAC OSX, and for Win32.  Various SDCC options can be
selected with:

  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCL=y : SDCC for Linux, MAC OSX or Cygwin (see below)
  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCW=y : SDCC for Win32

SDCC versions 3.2.0 or higher are recommended.

Building the SDCC toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also want to build your own SDCC toolchain.  You might want to do this,
for example, if you are running under Cygwin and want a Cygwin compatible
SDCC toolchain.

The SDCC toolchain is built with the standard configure/make/make install
sequence.  However, some special actions are required to generate libraries
compatible with this build.  First start with the usual steps

  download
  unpack
  cd sdcc
  ./configure

Then make the SDCC binaries

  cd sdcc
  make

and install SDCC:

  sudo make install
