Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems. Testing was performed using the Cygwin
  environment.

GNU Toolchain Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The CodeSourcery GNU toolchain,
  2. The devkitARM GNU toolchain,
  3. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below).

  All testing has been conducted using the NuttX buildroot toolchain.  However,
  the make system is setup to default to use the devkitARM toolchain.  To use
  the CodeSourcery or devkitARM toolchain, you simply need add one of the
  following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig) file:

    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y   : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYL=y   : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y       : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y       : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)

  If you are not using CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT, then you may also
  have to modify the PATH in the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery (for Windows)and devkitARM are Windows native toolchains.
  The CodeSourcey (for Linux) and NuttX buildroot toolchains are Cygwin and/or
  Linux native toolchains. There are several limitations to using a Windows based
  toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  NOTE 1: The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) does not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
^^^^

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project.

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/lpc17xx,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/lpc17x/lpc17_vectors.S.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh mbed/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you
  are building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE:  Unfortunately, the 4.6.3 EABI toolchain is not compatible with the
  the NXFLAT tools.  See the top-level TODO file (under "Binary loaders") for
  more information about this problem. If you plan to use NXFLAT, please do not
  use the GCC 4.6.3 EABI toochain; instead use the GCC 4.3.3 OABI toolchain.
  See instructions below.

NuttX OABI "buildroot" Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The older, OABI buildroot toolchain is also available.  To use the OABI
  toolchain:

  1. When building the buildroot toolchain, either (1) modify the cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3
     configuration to use EABI (using 'make menuconfig'), or (2) use an exising OABI
     configuration such as cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3

  2. Modify the Make.defs file to use the OABI conventions:

    +CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-elf-
    +ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mtune=cortex-m3 -march=armv7-m -mfloat-abi=soft
    +NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-gotoff.ld -no-check-sections
    -CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-eabi-
    -ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=soft
    -NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-pcrel.ld -no-check-sections

NXFLAT Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you are *not* using the NuttX buildroot toolchain and you want to use
  the NXFLAT tools, then you will still have to build a portion of the buildroot
  tools -- just the NXFLAT tools.  The buildroot with the NXFLAT tools can
  be downloaded from the NuttX Bitbucket download site
  (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/downloads/).

  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh lpcxpresso-lpc1768/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-nxflat .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly builtNXFLAT binaries.

mbed Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.  This should
       be set to:

       CONFIG_ARCH=arm

    CONFIG_ARCH_family - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_ARM=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM3=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP=lpc17xx

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code to identify the exact
       chip:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_LPC1768=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the configs subdirectory and
       hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=mbed (for the mbed.org board)

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_MBED=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation
       of delay loops

    CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little
       endian)

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (CPU SRAM in this case):

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=(32*1024) (32Kb)

       There is an additional 32Kb of SRAM in AHB SRAM banks 0 and 1.

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x10000000

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
       have LEDs

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
        stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
      used during interrupt handling.

    CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

    CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION - Enables some build in instrumentation that
       cause a 100 second delay during boot-up.  This 100 second delay
       serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibratre
       CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
       the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC until
       the delay actually is 100 seconds.

      Size of one end-user I/O buffer.  This can be zero if the
      application can guarantee that all end-user I/O buffers
      reside in AHB SRAM.

USB Host Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The mbed board can be easily modified to support a USB host interface
  (Remember to add 2 resistors of 15K to D+ and D- pins).  The hidkbd
  configuration assumes that this change has been made.

  The NuttShell (NSH) mbed can also be modified in order to support USB
  host operations.  To make these modifications, do the following:

  1. First configure to build the NSH configuration from the top-level
     NuttX directory:

     cd tools
     ./configure mbed/nsh
     cd ..

  2. Then edit the top-level .config file to enable USB host.  Make the
     following changes using 'make menuconfig':

     System Type -> LPC17xx Peripheral Support
       CONFIG_LPC17_USBHOST=y        : USB host controller driver support

     Device Drivers -> USB Host Driver Support
       CONFIG_USBHOST=y              : USB host support
       CONFIG_USBHOST_ISOC_DISABLE=y : Not needed
       CONFIG_USBHOST_MSC=y          : Mass storage class support

     Library Routines
       CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y      : Enable worker thread

  When this change is made, NSH should be extended to support USB flash
  devices.  When a FLASH device is inserted, you should see a device
  appear in the /dev (pseudo) directory.  The device name should be
  like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.  The USB mass storage device, is present
  it can be mounted from the NSH command line like:

     ls /dev
     mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mnt/flash

  Files on the connect USB flash device should then be accessible under
  the mountpoint /mnt/flash.

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  General
  -------

  Each mbed configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and can be selected
  as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh mbed/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

  Where <subdir> is one of the mbed subdirectories described in the
  following paragraph.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  Configuration Sub-directories
  -----------------------------

  hidkbd:
    This configuration directory, performs a simple test of the USB host
    HID keyboard class driver using the test logic in examples/hidkbd.
    This configuration assumes that you have modified your mbed for USB
    host support.

  nsh:
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables only the serial NSH interfaces.  See notes
    above for enabling USB host support in this configuration.
