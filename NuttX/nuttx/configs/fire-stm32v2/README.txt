This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the M3
Wildfire development board (STM32F103VET6).  See http://firestm32.taobao.com

This configuration should support both the version 2 and version 3 of the
Wildfire board (using NuttX configuration options).  However, only version 2
has been verified.

Development Environment
=======================

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems. Testing was performed using the Cygwin
  environment because the CodeSourcery Toolchain.

GNU Toolchain Options
=====================

  Toolchain Configurations
  ------------------------
  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The CodeSourcery GNU toolchain,
  2. The Atollic Toolchain,
  3. The devkitARM GNU toolchain,
  4. Raisonance GNU toolchain, or
  5. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below).

  Most testing has been conducted using the CodeSourcery toolchain for Windows and
  that is the default toolchain in most configurations.  To use the Atollic,
  devkitARM, Raisonance GNU, or NuttX buildroot toolchain, you simply need to
  add one of the following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig)
  file:

    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y  : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYL=y  : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=y        : The Atollic toolchain under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y      : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_RAISONANCE=y     : Raisonance RIDE7 under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y      : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)

  If you change the default toolchain, then you may also have to modify the PATH in
  the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery (for Windows), Atollic, devkitARM, and Raisonance toolchains are
  Windows native toolchains.  The CodeSourcery (for Linux) and NuttX buildroot
  toolchains are Cygwin and/or Linux native toolchains. There are several limitations
  to using a Windows based toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  The CodeSourcery Toolchain (2009q1)
  -----------------------------------
  The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) does not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  The Atollic "Pro" and "Lite" Toolchain
  --------------------------------------
  One problem that I had with the Atollic toolchains is that the provide a gcc.exe
  and g++.exe in the same bin/ file as their ARM binaries.  If the Atollic bin/ path
  appears in your PATH variable before /usr/bin, then you will get the wrong gcc
  when you try to build host executables.  This will cause to strange, uninterpretable
  errors build some host binaries in tools/ when you first make.

  The Atollic "Lite" Toolchain
  ----------------------------
  The free, "Lite" version of the Atollic toolchain does not support C++ nor
  does it support ar, nm, objdump, or objdcopy. If you use the Atollic "Lite"
  toolchain, you will have to set:

    CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=n

  In order to compile successfully.  Otherwise, you will get errors like:

    "C++ Compiler only available in TrueSTUDIO Professional"

  The make may then fail in some of the post link processing because of some of
  the other missing tools.  The Make.defs file replaces the ar and nm with
  the default system x86 tool versions and these seem to work okay.  Disable all
  of the following to avoid using objcopy:

    CONFIG_RRLOAD_BINARY=n
    CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=n
    CONFIG_MOTOROLA_SREC=n
    CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=n

  devkitARM
  ---------
  The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that the
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
====

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project.

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/stm32,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_vectors.S.  You many have to build NuttX
  one time from the Cygwin command line in order to obtain the pre-built
  startup object needed by an IDE.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh fire-stm32v2/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you are
  building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE:  Unfortunately, the 4.6.3 EABI toolchain is not compatible with the
  the NXFLAT tools.  See the top-level TODO file (under "Binary loaders") for
  more information about this problem. If you plan to use NXFLAT, please do not
  use the GCC 4.6.3 EABI toochain; instead use the GCC 4.3.3 OABI toolchain.
  See instructions below.

NuttX OABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  The older, OABI buildroot toolchain is also available.  To use the OABI
  toolchain:

  1. When building the buildroot toolchain, either (1) modify the cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3
     configuration to use EABI (using 'make menuconfig'), or (2) use an exising OABI
     configuration such as cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3

  2. Modify the Make.defs file to use the OABI conventions:

    +CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-elf-
    +ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mtune=cortex-m3 -march=armv7-m -mfloat-abi=soft
    +NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-gotoff.ld -no-check-sections
    -CROSSDEV = arm-nuttx-eabi-
    -ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=soft
    -NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat-pcrel.ld -no-check-sections

NXFLAT Toolchain
================

  If you are *not* using the NuttX buildroot toolchain and you want to use
  the NXFLAT tools, then you will still have to build a portion of the buildroot
  tools -- just the NXFLAT tools.  The buildroot with the NXFLAT tools can
  be downloaded from the NuttX Bitbucket download site
  (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/downloads/).

  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh lpcxpresso-lpc1768/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-nxflat .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly builtNXFLAT binaries.

DFU and JTAG
============

  Enbling Support for the DFU Bootloader
  --------------------------------------
  The linker files in these projects can be configured to indicate that you
  will be loading code using STMicro built-in USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU)
  loader or via some JTAG emulator.  You can specify the DFU bootloader by
  adding the following line:

    CONFIG_STM32_DFU=y

  to your .config file. Most of the configurations in this directory are set
  up to use the DFU loader.

  If CONFIG_STM32_DFU is defined, the code will not be positioned at the beginning
  of FLASH (0x08000000) but will be offset to 0x08003000.  This offset is needed
  to make space for the DFU loader and 0x08003000 is where the DFU loader expects
  to find new applications at boot time.  If you need to change that origin for some
  other bootloader, you will need to edit the file(s) ld.script.dfu for the
  configuration.

  The DFU SE PC-based software is available from the STMicro website,
  http://www.st.com.  General usage instructions:

  1. Convert the NuttX Intel Hex file (nuttx.hex) into a special DFU
     file (nuttx.dfu)... see below for details.
  2. Connect the M3 Wildfire board to your computer using a USB
     cable.
  3. Start the DFU loader on the M3 Wildfire board.  You do this by
     resetting the board while holding the "Key" button.  Windows should
     recognize that the DFU loader has been installed.
  3. Run the DFU SE program to load nuttx.dfu into FLASH.

  What if the DFU loader is not in FLASH?  The loader code is available
  inside of the Demo dirctory of the USBLib ZIP file that can be downloaded
  from the STMicro Website.  You can build it using RIDE (or other toolchains);
  you will need a JTAG emulator to burn it into FLASH the first time.

  In order to use STMicro's built-in DFU loader, you will have to get
  the NuttX binary into a special format with a .dfu extension.  The
  DFU SE PC_based software installation includes a file "DFU File Manager"
  conversion program that a file in Intel Hex format to the special DFU
  format.  When you successfully build NuttX, you will find a file called
  nutt.hex in the top-level directory.  That is the file that you should
  provide to the DFU File Manager.  You will end up with a file called
  nuttx.dfu that you can use with the STMicro DFU SE program.

  Enabling JTAG
  -------------
  If you are not using the DFU, then you will probably also need to enable
  JTAG support.  By default, all JTAG support is disabled but there NuttX
  configuration options to enable JTAG in various different ways.

  These configurations effect the setting of the SWJ_CFG[2:0] bits in the AFIO
  MAPR register.  These bits are used to configure the SWJ and trace alternate function I/Os. The SWJ (SerialWire JTAG) supports JTAG or SWD access to the
  Cortex debug port.  The default state in this port is for all JTAG support
  to be disable.

  CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_FULL_ENABLE - sets SWJ_CFG[2:0] to 000 which enables full
    SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP)

  CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_NOJNTRST_ENABLE - sets SWJ_CFG[2:0] to 001 which enable
    full SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP) but without JNTRST.

  CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_SW_ENABLE - sets SWJ_CFG[2:0] to 010 which would set JTAG-DP
    disabled and SW-DP enabled

  The default setting (none of the above defined) is SWJ_CFG[2:0] set to 100
  which disable JTAG-DP and SW-DP.

OpenOCD
=======

I have also used OpenOCD with the M3 Wildfire.  In this case, I used
the Olimex USB ARM OCD.  See the script in configs/fire-stm32v2/tools/oocd.sh
for more information.  Using the script:

1) Start the OpenOCD GDB server

   cd <nuttx-build-directory>
   configs/fire-stm32v2/tools/oocd.sh $PWD

2) Load Nuttx

   cd <nuttx-built-directory>
   arm-none-eabi-gdb nuttx
   gdb> target remote localhost:3333
   gdb> mon reset
   gdb> mon halt
   gdb> load nuttx

3) Running NuttX

   gdb> mon reset
   gdb> c

LEDs
====

The M3 Wildfire has 3 LEDs labeled LED1, LED2 and LED3.  These LEDs are not
used by the NuttX port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined.  In that case, the
usage by the board port is defined in include/board.h and src/up_autoleds.c.
The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as follows:

                                        /* LED1   LED2   LED3 */
  #define LED_STARTED                0  /* OFF    OFF    OFF */
  #define LED_HEAPALLOCATE           1  /* ON     OFF    OFF */
  #define LED_IRQSENABLED            2  /* OFF    ON     OFF */
  #define LED_STACKCREATED           3  /* OFF    OFF    OFF */

  #define LED_INIRQ                  4  /* NC     NC    ON  (momentary) */
  #define LED_SIGNAL                 5  /* NC     NC    ON  (momentary) */

RTC
===

  The STM32 RTC may configured using the following settings.

    CONFIG_RTC - Enables general support for a hardware RTC. Specific
      architectures may require other specific settings.
    CONFIG_RTC_HIRES - The typical RTC keeps time to resolution of 1
      second, usually supporting a 32-bit time_t value.  In this case,
      the RTC is used to &quot;seed&quot; the normal NuttX timer and the
      NuttX timer provides for higher resoution time. If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES
      is enabled in the NuttX configuration, then the RTC provides higher
      resolution time and completely replaces the system timer for purpose of
      date and time.
      CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY - If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is defined, then the
      frequency of the high resolution RTC must be provided.  If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES
      is not defined, CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY is assumed to be one.
    CONFIG_RTC_ALARM - Enable if the RTC hardware supports setting of an alarm.
      A callback function will be executed when the alarm goes off

  In hi-res mode, the STM32 RTC operates only at 16384Hz.  Overflow interrupts
  are handled when the 32-bit RTC counter overflows every 3 days and 43 minutes.
  A BKP register is incremented on each overflow interrupt creating, effectively,
  a 48-bit RTC counter.

  In the lo-res mode, the RTC operates at 1Hz.  Overflow interrupts are not handled
  (because the next overflow is not expected until the year 2106.

   WARNING:  Overflow interrupts are lost whenever the STM32 is powered down.  The
   overflow interrupt may be lost even if the STM32 is powered down only momentarily.
   Therefore hi-res solution is only useful in systems where the power is always on.

M3 Wildfire-specific Configuration Options
============================================

    CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.  This should
       be set to:

       CONFIG_ARCH=arm

    CONFIG_ARCH_family - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_ARM=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM3=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP=stm32

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code to identify the exact
       chip:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_STM32
       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_STM32F103VE

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG - Enables special STM32 clock
       configuration features.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG=n

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the configs subdirectory and
       hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=fire-stm32v2 (for the M3 Wildfire development board)

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_FIRE_STM32V2=y  (Version 2)
       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_FIRE_STM32V3=y  (Version 3)

    CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation
       of delay loops

    CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little
       endian)

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (SRAM in this case):

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x00010000 (64Kb)

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20000000

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
       have LEDs

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
        stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
      used during interrupt handling.

    CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

    CONFIG_ARCH_CALIBRATION - Enables some build in instrumentation that
       cause a 100 second delay during boot-up.  This 100 second delay
       serves no purpose other than it allows you to calibratre
       CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop watch to measure
       the 100 second delay then adjust CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC until
       the delay actually is 100 seconds.

  Timer and I2C devices may need to the following to force power to be applied
  unconditionally at power up.  (Otherwise, the device is powered when it is
  initialized).

    CONFIG_STM32_FORCEPOWER

  Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
  to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32_TIMn
  is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
  the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
  or DAC conversion.  Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
  to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
  configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,8
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,8
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADCm  Reserve timer n to trigger ADCm, n=1,..,8, m=1,..,3
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DAC   Reserve timer n for use by DAC, n=1,..,8
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DACm  Reserve timer n to trigger DACm, n=1,..,8, m=1,..,2

  For each timer that is enabled for PWM usage, we need the following additional
  configuration settings:

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMx_CHANNEL - Specifies the timer output channel {1,..,4}

  NOTE: The STM32 timers are each capable of generating different signals on
  each of the four channels with different duty cycles.  That capability is
  not supported by this driver:  Only one output channel per timer.

  Alternate pin mappings.  The M3 Wildfire board requires only CAN1 remapping
  On the M3 Wildfire board pin PB9 is wired as TX and pin PB8 is wired as RX.
  Which then makes the proper connection through the CAN transiver SN65HVD230
  out to the CAN D-type 9-pn male connector where pin 2 is CANL and pin 7 is CANH.

      4-bit transfer mode.

  M3 Wildfire CAN Configuration

    CONFIG_CAN - Enables CAN support (one or both of CONFIG_STM32_CAN1 or
      CONFIG_STM32_CAN2 must also be defined)
    CONFIG_CAN_EXTID - Enables support for the 29-bit extended ID.  Default

    CONFIG_CAN_TSEG2 - the number of CAN time quanta in segment 2. Default: 7
    CONFIG_STM32_CAN_REGDEBUG - If CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES is set, this will generate an
      dump of all CAN registers.

  M3 Wildfire LCD Hardware Configuration

    CONFIG_LCD_LANDSCAPE - Define for 320x240 display "landscape"
      support. Default is this 320x240 "landscape" orientation
      (this setting is informative only... not used).
    CONFIG_LCD_PORTRAIT - Define for 240x320 display "portrait"
      orientation support.  In this orientation, the M3 Wildfire's
      LCD ribbon cable is at the bottom of the display. Default is
      320x240 "landscape" orientation.
    CONFIG_LCD_RPORTRAIT - Define for 240x320 display "reverse
      portrait" orientation support.  In this orientation, the
      M3 Wildfire's LCD ribbon cable is at the top of the display.
      Default is 320x240 "landscape" orientation.
    CONFIG_LCD_BACKLIGHT - Define to support a backlight.
    CONFIG_LCD_PWM - If CONFIG_STM32_TIM1 is also defined, then an
      adjustable backlight will be provided using timer 1 to generate
      various pulse widthes.  The granularity of the settings is
      determined by CONFIG_LCD_MAXPOWER.  If CONFIG_LCD_PWM (or
      CONFIG_STM32_TIM1) is not defined, then a simple on/off backlight
      is provided.
    CONFIG_LCD_RDSHIFT - When reading 16-bit gram data, there appears
      to be a shift in the returned data.  This value fixes the offset.
      Default 5.

    The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
    ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
    individual LCDs using:

    CONFIG_STM32_AM240320_DISABLE
    CONFIG_STM32_SPFD5408B_DISABLE

Configurations
==============

Each M3 Wildfire configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh fire-stm32v2/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh
  ---
    Configure the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh. The nsh configuration
    contains support for some built-in applications that can be enabled by making
    some additional minor change to the configuration file.

    Reconfiguring:  This configuration uses to the kconfig-mconf configuration tool
    to control the configuration.  See the section entitled "NuttX Configuration
    Tool" in the top-level README.txt file.

    Start Delays:  If no SD card is present in the slot, or if the network is not
    connected, then there will be long start-up delays before you get the NSH
    prompt.  If I am focused on ENC28J60 debug, I usually disable MMC/SD so that
    I don't have to bother with the SD card:

      CONFIG_STM32_SDIO=n
      CONFIG_MMCSD=n

    STATUS:  The board port is basically functional. Not all features have been
    verified.  The ENC28J60 network is not yet functional.  Networking is
    enabled by default in this configuration for testing purposes.  To use this
    configuration, the network must currently be disabled.  To do this using
    the kconfig-mconf configuration tool:

    > make menuconfig

    Then de-select "Networking Support" -> "Networking Support"

    UPDATE:  The primary problem with the ENC29J60 is a v2 board issue:  The
    SPI FLASH and the ENC28J60 shared the same SPI chip select signal (PA4-SPI1-NSS).
    In order to finish the debug of the ENC28J60, it may be necessary to lift
    the SPI FLASH chip select pin from the board.
