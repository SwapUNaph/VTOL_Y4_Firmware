/*
 * Debug support for low-power modes
 * To enter low-power mode, the instruction WFI or WFE must be executed.
 * The MCU implements several low-power modes which can either deactivate the CPU clock
 * or reduce the power of the CPU.
 * The core does not allow FCLK or HCLK to be turned off during a debug session. As these
 * are required for the debugger connection, during a debug, they must remain active. The
 * MCU integrates special means to allow the user to debug software in low-power modes.
 * For this, the debugger host must first set some debug configuration registers to change the
 * low-power mode behavior:
 *   In Sleep mode, DBG_SLEEP bit of DBGMCU_CR register must be previously set by
 *   the debugger. This will feed HCLK with the same clock that is provided to FCLK
 *   (system clock previously configured by the software).
 * 	 In Stop mode, the bit DBG_STOP must be previously set by the debugger. This will
 *   enable the internal RC oscillator clock to feed FCLK and HCLK in STOP mode.
