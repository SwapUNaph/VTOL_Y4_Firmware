 * Description:

 *   to configure the USB HID mouse driver that emulates a touchscreen
 *   device.  This function will register the driver as /dev/mouseN where N
 *   is the minor device number.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   minor   - The mouse device minor number
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero is returned on success.  Otherwise, a negated errno value is
 *   returned to indicate the nature of the failure.
