 * Name: kmm_heapmember

 * Description:
 *   Check if an address lies in the kernel heap.

 * Parameters:
 *   mem - The address to check
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   true if the address is a member of the kernel heap.  false if not
 *   not.  If the address is not a member of the kernel heap, then it
 *   must be a member of the user-space heap (unchecked)
