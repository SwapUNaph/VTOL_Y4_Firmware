menuconfig NET_6LOWPAN
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN support"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NET_IPv6
	---help---
		Enable support for IEEE 802.15.4 Low power Wireless Personal Area
		Networking (6LoWPAN).

if NET_6LOWPAN

config NET_6LOWPAN_MTU
	int "6LoWPAN packet buffer size (MTU)"
	default 1294
	range 590 1518
	---help---
		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header, the IP header, and data link layer headers.
		This value is normally referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission
		Unit); the payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets,
		resulting in a minimum buffer size of of 1220+20+40+xx = xx. REVISIT!

config NET_6LOWPAN_TCP_RECVWNDO
	int "6LoWPAN TCP receive window size"
	default 1220
	depends on NET_TCP
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly. REVISIT!
