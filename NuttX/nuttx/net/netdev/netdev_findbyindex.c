 * Function: netdev_findbyindex
 *
 * Description:
 *   Find a previously registered network device by its position in the
 *   list of registered devices.  NOTE that this function is not a safe way
 *   to enumerate network devices:  There could be changes to the list of
 *   registered device causing a given index to be meaningless (unless, of
 *   course, the caller keeps the network locked).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   index - the index of the interface to file
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  Pointer to driver on success; NULL on failure.  This function can only
 *  fail if there are fewer registered interfaces than could be indexed.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *  Called from normal user mode
 *
