   * Reference: http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPv6AutoconfigurationandRenumbering.htm
   *
   * The following is a summary of the steps a device takes when using
   * stateless auto-configuration:
   *
   * 1. Link-Local Address Generation: The device generates a link-local
   *    address. Recall that this is one of the two types of local-use IPv6
   *    addresses. Link-local addresses have "1111 1110 10" for the first
   *    ten bits. The generated address uses those ten bits followed by 54
   *    zeroes and then the 64 bit interface identifier. Typically this
   *    will be derived from the data link layer (MAC) address.
   *
   *    IEEE 802 MAC addresses, used by Ethernet and other IEEE 802 Project
   *    networking technologies, have 48 bits.  The IEEE has also defined a
   *    format called the 64-bit extended unique identifier, abbreviated
   *    EUI-64.  To get the modified EUI-64 interface ID for a device, you
   *    simply take the EUI-64 address and change the 7th bit from the left
   *    (the"universal/local" or "U/L" bit) from a zero to a one.
   *
   *    128  112  96   80    64   48   32   16

   *    address came from a MAC address but more likely if it was based on a
   *    generated token.) It sends a Neighbor Solicitation message using the
   *    Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. It then listens for a Neighbor
   *    Advertisement in response that indicates that another device is
   *    already using its link-local address; if so, either a new address
   *    must be generated, or auto-configuration fails and another method
