/****************************************************************************
 * Name: icmpv6_neighbor
 *
 * Description:
 *   The icmpv6_solicit() call may be to send an ICMPv6 Neighbor
 *   Solicitation to resolve an IPv6 address.  This function first checks if
 *   the IPv6 address is already in the Neighbor Table.  If so, then it
 *   returns success immediately.
 *
 *   If the requested IPv6 address in not in the Neighbor Table, then this
 *   function will send the Neighbor Solicitation, delay, then check if the
 *   IP address is now in the Neighbor able.  It will repeat this sequence
 *   until either (1) the IPv6 address mapping is now in the Neighbor table,
 *   or (2) a configurable number of timeouts occur without receiving the
 *   ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   ipaddr   The IPv6 address to be queried.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success and the IP address mapping can now be
 *   found in the Neighbor Table.  On error a negated errno value is returned:
 *
 *     -ETIMEDOUT:    The number or retry counts has been exceed.
 *     -EHOSTUNREACH: Could not find a route to the host
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function is called from the normal tasking context.
