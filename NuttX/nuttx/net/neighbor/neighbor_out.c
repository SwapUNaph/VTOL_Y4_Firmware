 * Name: neighbor_out
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called before sending out an IPv6 packet. The
 *   function checks the destination IPv6 address of the IPv6 packet to see
 *   what Ethernet MAC address that should be used as a destination MAC
 *   address on the Ethernet.
 *
 *   If the destination IPv6 address is in the local network (determined
 *   by logical ANDing of netmask and our IPv6 address), the function
 *   checks the Neighbor Table to see if an entry for the destination IPv6
 *   address is found.  If so, an Ethernet header is pre-pended at the
 *   beginning of the packet and the function returns.
 *
 *   If no Neighbor Table entry is found for the destination IPv6 address,
 *   the packet in the d_buf is replaced by an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicit
 *   request packet for the IPv6 address. The IPv6 packet is dropped and 
 *   it is assumed that the higher level protocols (e.g., TCP) eventually
 *   will retransmit the dropped packet.
 *
 *   Upon return in either the case, a packet to be sent is present in the
 *   d_buf buffer and the d_len field holds the length of the Ethernet
 *   frame that should be transmitted.
