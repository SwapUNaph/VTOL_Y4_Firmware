/****************************************************************************
 * Name: psock_connect
 *
 * Description:
 *   connect() connects the socket referred to by the structure 'psock'
 *   to the address specified by 'addr'. The addrlen argument specifies
 *   the size of 'addr'.  The format of the address in 'addr' is
 *   determined by the address space of the socket 'psock'.
 *
 *   If the socket 'psock' is of type SOCK_DGRAM then 'addr' is the address
 *   to which datagrams are sent by default, and the only address from which
 *   datagrams are received. If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or
 *   SOCK_SEQPACKET, this call attempts to make a connection to the socket
 *   that is bound to the address specified by 'addr'.
 *
 *   Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect()
 *   only once; connectionless protocol sockets may use connect() multiple
 *   times to change their association.  Connectionless sockets may dissolve
 *   the association by connecting to an address with the sa_family member of
 *   sockaddr set to AF_UNSPEC.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock     Pointer to a socket structure initialized by psock_socket()
 *   addr      Server address (form depends on type of socket)
 *   addrlen   Length of actual 'addr'
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 on success; -1 on error with errno set appropriately
 *
 *     EACCES, EPERM
 *       The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without having the
 *       socket broadcast flag enabled or the connection request failed
 *       because of a local firewall rule.
 *     EADDRINUSE
 *       Local address is already in use.
 *     EAFNOSUPPORT
 *       The passed address didn't have the correct address family in its
 *       sa_family field.
 *     EAGAIN
 *       No more free local ports or insufficient entries in the routing
 *       cache.
 *     EALREADY
 *       The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt has
 *       not yet been completed.
 *     EBADF
 *       The file descriptor is not a valid index in the descriptor table.
 *     ECONNREFUSED
 *       No one listening on the remote address.
 *     EFAULT
 *       The socket structure address is outside the user's address space.
 *     EINPROGRESS
 *       The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be completed
 *       immediately.
 *     EINTR
 *       The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught.
 *     EISCONN
 *       The socket is already connected.
 *     ENETUNREACH
 *       Network is unreachable.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: connect
 *
 * Description:
 *   connect() connects the socket referred to by the file descriptor 'sockfd'
 *   to the address specified by 'addr'. The addrlen argument specifies
 *   the size of 'addr'.  The format of the address in 'addr' is
 *   determined by the address space of the socket 'sockfd'.
 *
 *   If the socket 'sockfd' is of type SOCK_DGRAM then 'addr' is the address
 *   to which datagrams are sent by default, and the only address from which
 *   datagrams are received. If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or
 *   SOCK_SEQPACKET, this call attempts to make a connection to the socket
 *   that is bound to the address specified by 'addr'.
 *
 *   Generally, connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect()
 *   only once; connectionless protocol sockets may use connect() multiple
 *   times to change their association.  Connectionless sockets may dissolve
 *   the association by connecting to an address with the sa_family member of
 *   sockaddr set to AF_UNSPEC.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sockfd    Socket descriptor returned by socket()
 *   addr      Server address (form depends on type of socket)
 *   addrlen   Length of actual 'addr'
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 on success; -1 on error with errno set appropriately
 *
 *     EACCES, EPERM
 *       The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without having the
 *       socket broadcast flag enabled or the connection request failed
 *       because of a local firewall rule.
 *     EADDRINUSE
 *       Local address is already in use.
 *     EAFNOSUPPORT
 *       The passed address didn't have the correct address family in its
 *       sa_family field.
 *     EAGAIN
 *       No more free local ports or insufficient entries in the routing
 *       cache.
 *     EALREADY
 *       The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt has
 *       not yet been completed.
 *     EBADF
 *       The file descriptor is not a valid index in the descriptor table.
 *     ECONNREFUSED
 *       No one listening on the remote address.
 *     EFAULT
 *       The socket structure address is outside the user's address space.
 *     EINPROGRESS
 *       The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be completed
 *       immediately.
 *     EINTR
 *       The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught.
 *     EISCONN
 *       The socket is already connected.
 *     ENETUNREACH
 *       Network is unreachable.
 *     ENOTSOCK
 *       The file descriptor is not associated with a socket.
 *     ETIMEDOUT
 *       Timeout while attempting connection. The server may be too busy
 *       to accept new connections.
 *
 * Assumptions:
