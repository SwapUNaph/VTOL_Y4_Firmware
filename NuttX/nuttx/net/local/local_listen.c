 * Name: local_listen
 *
 * Description:
 *   Listen for a new connection of a SOCK_STREAM Unix domain socket.
 *
 *   This function is called as part of the implementation of listen();
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   server  - A reference to the server-side local connection structure
 *   backlog - Maximum number of pending connections.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The network is NOT locked
 *
