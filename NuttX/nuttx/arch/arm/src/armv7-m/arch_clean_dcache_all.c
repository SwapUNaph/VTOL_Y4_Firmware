 * Name: arch_clean_dcache_all
 *
 * Description:
 *   Clean the entire data cache within the specified region by flushing the
 *   contents of the data cache to memory.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This operation is not atomic.  This function assumes that the caller
 *   has exclusive access to the address range so that no harm is done if
 *   the operation is pre-empted.
