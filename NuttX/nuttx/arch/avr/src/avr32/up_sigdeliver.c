   *      he same stack.
   *   2. In this case, up_fullcontextrestore is called with r12 pointing to
   *      a register save area on the stack to be destroyed.  This is
   *      dangerous because there is the very real possibility that the new
   *      stack pointer might overlap with the register save area and hat stack
   *      usage in up_fullcontextrestore might corrupt the register save data
   *      before the state is restored.  At present, there does not appear to
   *      be any stack overlap problems.  If there were, then adding 3 words
   *      to the size of register save structure size will protect its contents.
