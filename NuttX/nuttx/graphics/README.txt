Roadmap
^^^^^^^

This directory holds NuttX graphic packages.  Not all of these packages are implemented
at the present, but here is the longer term roadmap:

  NxWidgets - NxWidgets is a higher level, C++, object-oriented library for object-
              oriented access to graphics "widgets."  NxWidgets is provided as a separate
              package.  NxWidgets is built on top of the core NuttX graphics subsystem,
              but is not a part of the core graphics subystems.
  NXTOOLKIT - A set of C graphics tools that provide higher-level window drawing
              operations.  The toolkit can be used for window-oriented graphics
              without NxWidgets and is built on top of NX.
  NXFONTS   - A set of C graphics tools for present (bitmap) font images.
  NX        - The tiny NuttX windowing system.  This includes both a small-footprint,
              single user implementaton (NXSU as described below) and a somewhat
              larger multi-user implentation (NXMU as described below).  Both
              conform to the same APIs as defined in include/nuttx/nx/nx.h and, hence,
              are more-or-less interchangable.  NX can be used without NxWidgets
              and without NXTOOLKIT for raw access to window memory.
  NXGLIB    - Low level graphics utilities and direct framebuffer rendering logic.
              NX is built on top of NXGLIB.
  NxTerm - NxTerm is a write-only character device that is built on top of
              an NX window.  This character device can be used to provide stdout
              and stderr and, hence, can provide the output side of NuttX console.
              NxTerm is only available when the multi-user NX implementation is
              selected (CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSERs).

Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^

  The graphics capability consist both of components internal to the RTOS
  and of user-callable interfaces.  In the NuttX kernel mode build there are
  some components of the graphics subsystem are callable in user mode and other
  components that are internal to the RTOS.  This directory, nuttx/graphics,
  contains only those components that are internal to the RTOS.

  User callable functions must, instead, be part of a library that can be
  linked against user applications.  This user callable interfaces are
  provided in sub-directories under nuttx/libnx.

libnx/nx
  Common callable interfaces that are, logically, part of both nxmu and nxsu.

graphics/nxglib
libnx/nxglib
  The NuttX tiny graphics library.  The directory contains generic utilities
  support operations on primitive graphics objects and logic to rasterize directly
  into a framebuffer.  It has no concept of windows (other than the one, framebuffer
  window).

graphics/nxbe
  This is the "back-end" of a tiny windowing system.  It can be used with either of
  two front-ends to complete a windowing system (see nxmu and nxsu below).  It
  contains most of the important window management logic:  clipping, window controls,
  window drawing, etc.

graphics/nxsu
  This is the NX single user "front end".  When combined with the generic "back-end"
  (nxbe), it implements a single thread, single user windowing system.  The files
  in this directory present the window APIs described in include/nuttx/nx/nx.h.  The
  single user front-end is selected when CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSER is not defined in the
  NuttX configuration file.

  NOTE:  There is no nxsu sub-directory in nuttx/libnx.  That is because this
  separation of interfaces is only required in the kernel build mode and
  only the multi-user interfaces can be used with the kernel build.

graphics/nxmu
libnx/nxmu
  This is the NX multi user "front end".  When combined with the generic "back-end"
  (nxbe), it implements a multi-threaded, multi-user windowing system.  The files
  in this directory present the window APIs described in include/nuttx/nx/nx.h.  The
  multi-user front end includes a graphics server that executes on its own thread;
  multiple graphics clients then communicate with the server via a POSIX message
  queue to serialize window operations from many threads. The multi-user front-end
  is selected when CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSER is defined in the NuttX configuration file.

libnx/nxfonts
  This is where the NXFONTS implementation resides.  This is a relatively low-
  level set of charset set/glyph management APIs.  See include/nuttx/nx/nxfonts.h

libnx/nxtk
  This is where the NXTOOLKIT implementation resides.  This toolkit is built on
  top of NX and works with either the single-user or multi-user NX version. See
  include/nuttx/nx/nxtk.h

nuttx/../NxWidgets
  The NxWidgets code is provided as a separate package located outside of the
  NuttX source tree (probably at this location).

graphics/vnc
  The future home of the VNC Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) server and client
  implementations.

Installing New Fonts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  There is a tool called bdf-converter in the directory tools/.  The bdf-converter
  program be used to convert fonts in Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF)
  into fonts that can be used in the NX graphics system.

  Below are general instructions for creating and installing a new font
  in the NX graphic system:

    1. Locate a font in BDF format,
    2. Use the bdf-converter program to convert the BDF font to the NuttX
       font format.  This will result in a C header file containing
       defintions.  That header file should be installed at, for example,
       graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_myfont.h.

  Create a new NuttX configuration variable.  For example, suppose
  you define the following variable:  CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT.  Then
  you would need to:

    3. Define CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT=y in your NuttX configuration file.

  A font ID number has to be assigned for each new font.  The font ID
  is defined in the file include/nuttx/nx/nxfonts.h.  Those definitions
  have to be extended to support your new font.  Look at how the font ID
  enabled by CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27 is defined and add an ID for your
  new font in a similar fashion:

    4. include/nuttx/nx/nxfonts.h. Add you new font as a possible system
       default font:

       #if defined(CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27)
       # define NXFONT_DEFAULT FONTID_SANS23X27
       #elif defined(CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT)
       # define NXFONT_DEFAULT FONTID_MYFONT
       #endif

       Then define the actual font ID.  Make sure that the font ID value
       is unique:

       enum nx_fontid_e
       {
         FONTID_DEFAULT     = 0      /* The default font */
       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27
         , FONTID_SANS23X27 = 1      /* The 23x27 sans serif font */
       #endif
       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT
         , FONTID_MYFONT    = 2      /* My shiny, new font */
       #endif
       ...

  New Add the font to the NX build system.  There are several files that
  you have to modify to to this.  Look how the build system uses the
  font CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27 for examaples:

    5. nuttx/graphics/Makefile.  This file needs logic to auto-generate
       a C source file from the header file that you generated with the
       the bdf-converter program.  Notice NXFONTS_FONTID=2; this must be
       set to the same font ID value that you defined in the
       include/nuttx/nx/nxfonts.h file.

       genfontsources:
         ifeq ($(CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27),y)
          @$(MAKE) -C nxfonts -f Makefile.sources TOPDIR=$(TOPDIR) NXFONTS_FONTID=1 EXTRADEFINES=$(EXTRADEFINES)
        endif
         ifeq ($(CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT),y)
          @$(MAKE) -C nxfonts -f Makefile.sources TOPDIR=$(TOPDIR) NXFONTS_FONTID=2 EXTRADEFINES=$(EXTRADEFINES)
        endif

    6. nuttx/graphics/nxfonts/Make.defs.  Set the make variable NXFSET_CSRCS.
       NXFSET_CSRCS determines the name of the font C file to build when
       NXFONTS_FONTID=2:

       ifeq ($(CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27),y)
       NXFSET_CSRCS += nxfonts_bitmaps_sans23x27.c
       endif
       ifeq ($(CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT),y)
       NXFSET_CSRCS += nxfonts_bitmaps_myfont.c
       endif

    7. nuttx/graphics/nxfonts/Makefile.sources.  This is the Makefile used
       in step 5 that will actually generate the font C file.  So, given
       your NXFONTS_FONTID=2, it needs to determine a prefix to use for
       auto-generated variable and function names and (again) the name of
       the autogenerated file to create (this must be the same name that
       was used in nuttx/graphics/nxfonts/Make.defs):

       ifeq ($(NXFONTS_FONTID),1)
       NXFONTS_PREFIX := g_sans23x27_
       GEN_CSRC = nxfonts_bitmaps_sans23x27.c
       endif
       ifeq ($(NXFONTS_FONTID),2)
       NXFONTS_PREFIX := g_myfont_
       GEN_CSRC = nxfonts_bitmaps_myfont.c
       endif

    8. graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_bitmaps.c.  This is the file that contains
       the generic font structures.  It is used as a "template" file by
       nuttx/graphics/nxfonts/Makefile.sources to create your customized
       font data set.

       #if NXFONTS_FONTID == 1
       #  include "nxfonts_sans23x27.h"
       #elif NXFONTS_FONTID == 2
       #  include "nxfonts_myfont.h"
       #else
       #  error "No font ID specified"
       #endif

       Where nxfonts_myfont.h is the NuttX font file that we generated in
       step 2 using the bdf-converter tool.

    9. graphics/nxfonts/nxfonts_getfont.c.  Finally, we need to extend the
       logic that does the run-time font lookups so that can find our new
       font.  The lookup function is NXHANDLE nxf_getfonthandle(enum nx_fontid_e fontid).
       The new font information needs to be added to data structures used by
       that function:

       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27
       extern const struct nx_fontpackage_s g_sans23x27_package;
       #endif
       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT
       extern const struct nx_fontpackage_s g_myfont_package;
       #endif

       static FAR const struct nx_fontpackage_s *g_fontpackages[] =
       {
       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS23X27
       &g_sans23x27_package,
       #endif
       #ifdef CONFIG_NXFONT_MYFONT
       &g_myfont_package,
       #endif
       NULL
       };

Configuration Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General NX Settings
-------------------

CONFIG_NX
  Enables overall support for graphics library and NX
CONFIG_NX_MULTIUSER
  Configures NX in multi-user mode

NxTerm Configuration Settings
--------------------------------

CONFIG_NXTERM
  Enables building of the NxTerm driver.

NxTerm output text/graphics options:

CONFIG_NXTERM_BPP
  Currently, NxTerm supports only a single pixel depth. This
  configuration setting must be provided to support that single pixel depth.
  Default: The smallest enabled pixel depth. (see CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_*BPP)
CONFIG_NXTERM_CURSORCHAR
  The bitmap code to use as the cursor.  Default '_'
CONFIG_NXTERM_MXCHARS
  NxTerm needs to remember every character written to the console so
  that it can redraw the window. This setting determines the size of some
  internal memory allocations used to hold the character data. Default: 128.
CONFIG_NXTERM_CACHESIZE
  NxTerm supports caching of rendered fonts. This font caching is required
  for two reasons: (1) First, it improves text performance, but more
  importantly (2) it preserves the font memory. Since the NX server runs on
  a separate server thread, it requires that the rendered font memory persist
  until the server has a chance to render the font. Unfortunately, the font
  cache would be quite large if all fonts were saved. The CONFIG_NXTERM_CACHESIZE
  setting will control the size of the font cache (in number of glyphs). Only that
  number of the most recently used glyphs will be retained. Default: 16.
  NOTE: There can still be a race condition between the NxTerm driver and the
  NX task.  If you every see character corruption (especially when printing
  a lot of data or scrolling), then increasing the value of CONFIG_NXTERM_CACHESIZE
  is something that you should try.  Alternatively, you can reduce the size of
  CONFIG_MQ_MAXMSGSIZE which will force NxTerm task to pace the server task.
  CONFIG_NXTERM_CACHESIZE should be larger than CONFIG_MQ_MAXMSGSIZE in any event.
CONFIG_NXTERM_LINESEPARATION
  This the space (in rows) between each row of test.  Default: 0
CONFIG_NXTERM_NOWRAP
  By default, lines will wrap when the test reaches the right hand side
  of the window. This setting can be defining to change this behavior so
  that the text is simply truncated until a new line is  encountered.

NxTerm Input options

CONFIG_NXTERM_NXKBDIN
  Take input from the NX keyboard input callback.  By default, keyboard
  input is taken from stdin (/dev/console).  If this option is set, then
  the interface nxterm_kdbin() is enabled.  That interface may be driven
  by window callback functions so that keyboard input *only* goes to the
  top window.
CONFIG_NXTERM_KBDBUFSIZE
  If CONFIG_NXTERM_NXKBDIN is enabled, then this value may be used to
  define the size of the per-window keyboard input buffer.  Default: 16
CONFIG_NXTERM_NPOLLWAITERS
  The number of threads that can be waiting for read data available.
  Default: 4

NX Multi-user only options
--------------------------

CONFIG_NX_BLOCKING
  Open the client message queues in blocking mode.  In this case,
  nx_eventhandler() will not return until a message is received and processed.
CONFIG_NX_MXSERVERMSGS and CONFIG_NX_MXCLIENTMSGS
  Specifies the maximum number of messages that can fit in the message queues.
  No additional resources are allocated, but this can be set to prevent
  flooding of the client or server with too many messages (CONFIG_PREALLOC_MQ_MSGS
  controls how many messages are pre-allocated).
