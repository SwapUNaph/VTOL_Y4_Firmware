	string "Program name"
	default "nsh"
	depends on BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		This is the name of the program that will be use when the NSH ELF
		program is installed.

config EXAMPLES_NSH_CXXINITIALIZE
	bool "C++ Initialization"
	default n
	depends on HAVE_CXX && HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE
	---help---
		If HAVE_CXX and HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are slected, then this NSH
		example can be configured to initialize C++ constructors when it
		is started.  NSH does not use C++ and, by default, assumes that
		constructors are initialized elsewhere.  However, you can force
		NSH to initialize constructors by setting this option.
